[Tool] Spring API Generator - New IntelliJ plugin for Spring Boot rapid development

Hi fellow Java/Spring developers!

I've just released a new IntelliJ IDEA plugin called **Spring API Generator** that aims to eliminate boilerplate code in Spring Boot projects.

**What it does:**
The plugin can generate an entire REST API infrastructure from your JPA entities with a single click, including:

- REST Controllers with CRUD operations
- Service interfaces and implementations
- Data Transfer Objects with validation
- MapStruct mappers for entity-DTO conversion
- Spring Data repositories
- JUnit 5 tests with Mockito for all components

It also works in reverse - you can connect to an existing database and generate entities + the complete API stack.

**Why I built it:**
After years of writing similar CRUD operations across dozens of Spring Boot projects, I decided to automate this repetitive work. The plugin follows best practices for Spring Boot architecture and can be customized to match your project's structure.

**Download:**
You can find it on the JetBrains Marketplace: [MARKETPLACE_LINK]

I'd love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or feature requests!

# Introducing Spring API Generator: Boost Your Spring Boot Development Speed

Are you tired of writing the same CRUD operations over and over again in your Spring Boot projects? Today, I'm excited to introduce **Spring API Generator**, a new IntelliJ IDEA plugin that automates the creation of complete Spring Boot REST APIs from JPA entities or database schemas.

## The Problem

Building Spring Boot applications often involves creating multiple layers of code:
- Controllers to handle HTTP requests
- Services for business logic
- DTOs for data transfer
- Repositories for database operations
- Tests to ensure everything works correctly

This can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies, especially in larger projects with many entities.

## The Solution

Spring API Generator addresses this by automating the creation of these components while following best practices. With just a few clicks, you can generate:

# Accelerating Spring Boot Development with the Spring API Generator Plugin

## Abstract
This article introduces the Spring API Generator, a new IntelliJ IDEA plugin that automates the creation of Spring Boot REST APIs from JPA entities or database schemas, significantly reducing development time and ensuring architectural consistency.

## Introduction
Spring Boot has become the de facto standard for building Java-based web applications, but it still requires significant boilerplate code. This article explores how the newly released Spring API Generator plugin can eliminate most of this repetitive coding work, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead.

Subject: [TOOL] Spring API Generator - IntelliJ plugin for automating Spring Boot code generation

Hello Spring community,

I'd like to share a new IntelliJ IDEA plugin I've developed called "Spring API Generator" that might save you significant development time on Spring Boot projects.

The plugin automatically generates complete Spring Boot REST APIs from your JPA entities (or directly from database schemas). It creates:

1. Controllers with full CRUD operations
2. Service interfaces and implementations
3. DTO classes with validation annotations
4. MapStruct mappers for entity-DTO conversion
5. Spring Data JPA repositories
6. JUnit 5 tests with Mockito for all components

I designed it to follow Spring Boot best practices and to be highly configurable - you can choose which components to generate and customize the target packages.

The plugin is available on the JetBrains Marketplace: [MARKETPLACE_LINK]

I welcome any feedback, feature requests, or contributions!

Best regards,
